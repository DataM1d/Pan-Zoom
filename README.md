# Pan-Zoom
Pan and zoom JS/CSS/HTML

Zooming:
Use the mouse scroll wheel to smoothly zoom in and out of the canvas.

Drawing Points:
Left-click anywhere on the canvas to create a point.

Removing Points:
Right-click on a point to remove it from the canvas.

Drawing Lines:
When you create a point, a dotted line will dynamically follow your cursor, allowing you to connect it to the next point.
If you decide not to continue the line, right-click to cancel the current connection.
The point will remain on the canvas, and you can start drawing a new line or create another standalone point.

Dragging the point & lines:
By clicking and holding the left mouse button on a point, you can drag it to a new position.
Any lines connected to that point automatically follow the movement, just like when drawing a new line

Saving and Clearing the Canvas:
Dedicated buttons are provided to save or clear your work.

Save: Stores your current canvas drawing in local storage, preserving it for future sessions.

Clear: Removes all elements from the canvas, allowing you to start fresh.
